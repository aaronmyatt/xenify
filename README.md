## Blurb
Whenever I get an opportunity to bootstrap a "Breakable Toy" project, I can't help but use it as an opportunity to learn a few tools I've had my eye on (e.g. Vite, Vue3, Typescript), how else to make it extra fun (and stressful!).

I've put a fair amount of effort in to ensure I've met the minimum requirements, and as much polish as I could sneak in within the limited time I could spare for this, including functional cart, basic search, persistent state (Local Storage), and also some fun with gestures and animations on the mobile version, check it out:

All in all, I had fun building and learning my way through this.

Don't forgot to give thanks to our Lord and Saviour, Nicholas :troll:
